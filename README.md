# Voice to MIDI

Max for Live plugin to play MIDI instruments with your voice.

The goal of this plugin is to help anybody play any instrument without having to spend several years learning how to play it. Instead, you'll only need lo-fi voice recordings and virtual MIDI instruments to be able to play anything you want.

## How it works

The plugin converts audio inputs to MIDI information:
- Amplitude is converted to velocity
- Pitch is converted to MIDI notes
- Tremolo and small pitch variations are converted to pitch bend

In addition, you can play chords by playing MIDI notes while singing.

## Usage
